# Bonus Assignment

## Problems
- Tseitin (NNF to CNF)
- DPLL
- Klee (Bugs in `coreutils`)
- Graph Vertex Cover to CNF
  - also includes a secondary algorithm to cross-check our encoding

## Utils
- our own `generateNNF.py` to generate random NNFs
  - our professor's fuzzy `gen_form.py` as submodule
    - useful command to keep up to date: `git submodule foreach git pull origin master`
- our own `genAdjacencyMatrix.py`to generate random adjacency matrices (bottom-left half)
