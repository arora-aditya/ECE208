# Tutorial 6

- The biggest thing I learnt from this lesson is system dependencies. The amount of time it took me realize that was crazy. More often than not, something during installation would error out, and I would have to spend over 2 hours to figure out the error.
  - The installation that did work for me, worked on my personal Ubuntu machine
  - At one point, the following addition to one of the commands, fixed an error I could not figure out for over two hours: `LDFLAGS="-fuse-ld=gold"`
